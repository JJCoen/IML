A [workflowr][] project.

Prior to running the analysis notebooks and updating the research website, at least a cursory knowledge of `workflowr` is necessary.

If one only wants to run the analysis files, then all of the rmarkdown and jupyter python notebooks are in the `code` subdirectory.  Please set the working directory for RStudio to that directory in order to run the .Rmd files.  Similarly, open Jupyter in the `code` directory and run the .IPYNB files from there.
